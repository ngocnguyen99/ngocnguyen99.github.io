My name is Ngoc /knock/ Nguyen; I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate at the University of California, Berkeley (Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management), advised by Dr. Trevor Keenan.
I  obtained my B.S. Degree in Environmental Science at the University of Denver in 2021 with Mathematics and Leadership Studies minors.  
I love the environment and want to contribute to mitigating climate change, so I follow the footprint of CO2 in our ecosystems.

I study climate-ecosystem carbon flux interactions by synthesizing large ecological datasets and applying novel machine learning approaches. 
My research focuses on modeling and predicting global ecosystem CO2 fluxes under extreme climates, using in-situ eddy-covariance observations, Land Surface Models (LSMs), and remote sensing data.
