    My name is Ngoc (/knock/); I am a 4th-year PhD Candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, supervised by Prof. Trevor Keenan. I follow the footprint of CO₂ fluxes in our ecosystems to understand the extent to which global vegetation and soil microbes capture and release CO₂ under current climate variability. My work has crucial applications in evaluating and informing nature-based climate solutions that utilize natural ecosystems as long-term carbon pools.

    I synthesize large ecological datasets and apply novel machine learning approaches ranging from tree-based models to large language models (LLMs). My research uses in situ eddy-covariance observations, Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), and remote sensing data to model and predict global carbon fluxes and pools under high climate variability and elevated CO₂.
