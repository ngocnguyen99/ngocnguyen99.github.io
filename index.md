My name is Ngoc (/knock/); I am a 4th-year PhD Candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, supervised by Prof. Trevor Keenan. I follow the footprint of CO2 fluxes in our ecosystems to understand the extent to which global vegetation and soil microbes capture and release CO₂ under current climate variability.

My work has crucial applications in evaluating and informing nature-based climate solutions that utilize natural ecosystems as long-term carbon pools.

  I study climate-ecosystem carbon flux interactions by synthesizing large ecological datasets
  and applying novel machine learning approaches. My research focuses on modeling and
  predicting global ecosystem carbon fluxes and pools under high climate variability and elevated CO2, using in situ eddy-covariance
  observations, Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), and remote sensing data.
